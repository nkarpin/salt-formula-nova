============
Usage
============

OpenStack Nova provides a cloud computing fabric controller, supporting a wide
variety of virtualization technologies, including KVM, Xen, LXC, VMware, and
more. In addition to its native API, it includes compatibility with the
commonly encountered Amazon EC2 and S3 APIs.

Sample Pillars
==============

        message_queue:
          port: 5671
          ssl:
            enabled: True
            (optional) cacert: cert body if the cacert_file does not exists
            (optional) cacert_file: /etc/openstack/rabbitmq-ca.pem
            (optional) version: TLSv1_2

- **MySQL TLS**

  .. code-block:: yaml

            (optional) cacert_file: /etc/openstack/mysql-ca.pem

- **Openstack HTTPS API**

  Set the ``https`` as protocol at ``nova:compute`` and
  ``nova:controller`` sections :

  .. code-block:: yaml

Compute with vmware driver. Each vmware cluster requires a separate process of nova-compute.
Each process should have uniq host identifier. However multiple computes might be running on
single host. It is not recommended to have multiple computes running on different hosts that
manage the same vmware cluster. To achive this pacemaker/corosync or keepalived might be used.

SR-IOV
------

Add ``PciPassthroughFilter`` into scheduler filters and NICs on
specific compute nodes:

.. code-block:: yaml

  nova:
    controller:
      sriov: true
      scheduler_default_filters: "DifferentHostFilter,SameHostFilter,RetryFilter,AvailabilityZoneFilter,RamFilter,CoreFilter,DiskFilter,ComputeFilter,ComputeCapabilitiesFilter,ImagePropertiesFilter,ServerGroupAntiAffinityFilter,ServerGroupAffinityFilter,PciPassthroughFilter"

  nova:
    compute:
      sriov:
        nic_one:
          devname: eth1
          physical_network: physnet1

.. note:: Parameters located under nova:compute:sriov:<nic_name> are copied to passthrough_whitelist parameter into
          nova.conf file in appropriate format.

CPU pinning & Hugepages
-----------------------

CPU pinning of virtual machine instances to dedicated physical
CPU cores. Hugepages mount point for libvirt.

.. code-block:: yaml

  nova:
    controller:
      scheduler_default_filters: "DifferentHostFilter,SameHostFilter,RetryFilter,AvailabilityZoneFilter,RamFilter,CoreFilter,DiskFilter,ComputeFilter,ComputeCapabilitiesFilter,ImagePropertiesFilter,ServerGroupAntiAffinityFilter,ServerGroupAffinityFilter,NUMATopologyFilter,AggregateInstanceExtraSpecsFilter"

  nova:
    compute:
      vcpu_pin_set: 2,3,4,5
      hugepages:
        mount_points:
        - path: /mnt/hugepages_1GB
        - path: /mnt/hugepages_2MB

Custom Scheduler filters
------------------------

If you have a custom filter, that needs to be included in the
scheduler, then you can include it like so:

.. code-block:: yaml

  nova:
    controller:
      scheduler_custom_filters:
      - my_custom_driver.nova.scheduler.filters.my_custom_filter.MyCustomFilter

      # Then add your custom filter on the end (make sure to include all other ones that you need as well)
      scheduler_default_filters: "DifferentHostFilter,SameHostFilter,RetryFilter,AvailabilityZoneFilter,RamFilter,CoreFilter,DiskFilter,ComputeFilter,ComputeCapabilitiesFilter,ImagePropertiesFilter,ServerGroupAntiAffinityFilter,ServerGroupAffinityFilter,PciPassthroughFilter,MyCustomFilter"

      # Since Queens version a sequence could be used as well:
      ~scheduler_default_filters:
         - DifferentHostFilter
         - SameHostFilter
           ...
         - MyCustomFilter


Hardware Trip/Unmap Support
---------------------------

To enable TRIM support for ephemeral images (thru nova managed
images), libvirt has this option:

.. code-block:: yaml

  nova:
    compute:
      libvirt:
        hw_disk_discard: unmap

To actually utilize this feature, the following metadata must be
set on the image as well, so the SCSI unmap is supported:

.. code-block:: bash

  glance image-update --property hw_scsi_model=virtio-scsi <image>
  glance image-update --property hw_disk_bus=scsi <image>

Scheduler Host Manager
----------------------

Specify a custom host manager.

libvirt CPU mode
----------------

Allow setting the model of CPU that is exposed to a VM. This
allows for better support live migration between hypervisors with
different hardware, among other things. Defaults to host-passthrough.

.. code-block:: yaml

  nova:
    controller:
      scheduler_host_manager: ironic_host_manager

    compute:
      cpu_mode: host-model

Nova compute cpu model
----------------------

.. code-block:: yaml

  nova:
    compute:
      cpu_mode: custom
      libvirt:
        cpu_model: IvyBridge


Nova compute workarounds
------------------------

Live snapshotting is disabled by default in nova. To enable
this, it needs a manual switch.

From manual:

.. code-block:: yaml

  When using libvirt 1.2.2 live snapshots fail intermittently under load
  (likely related to concurrent libvirt/qemu operations). This config
  option provides a mechanism to disable live snapshot, in favor of cold
  snapshot, while this is resolved. Cold snapshot causes an instance
  outage while the guest is going through the snapshotting process.

  For more information, refer to the bug report:

  https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1334398

Configurable pillar data:

.. code-block:: yaml

  nova:
    compute:
      workaround:
        disable_libvirt_livesnapshot: False

Config drive options
--------------------

See example below on how to configure the options for the
config drive:

.. code-block:: yaml

  nova:
    compute:
      config_drive:
        forced: True  # Default: True
        cdrom: True  # Default: False
        format: iso9660  # Default: vfat
        inject_password: False  # Default: False

Number of concurrent live migrates
----------------------------------

Default is to have no concurrent live migrations (so 1
live-migration at a time).

Excerpt from config options page
https://docs.openstack.org/ocata/config-reference/compute/config-options.html:

Maximum number of live migrations to run concurrently. This limit is
enforced to avoid outbound live migrations overwhelming the host/network
and causing failures. It is not recommended that you change this unless
you are very sure that doing so is safe and stable in your environment.

Possible values:

- 0 : treated as unlimited.
- Negative value defaults to 0.
- Any positive integer representing maximum number of live migrations
  to run concurrently.

To configure this option:

.. code-block:: yaml

  nova:
    compute:
      max_concurrent_live_migrations: 1  # (1 is the default)

Live migration with auto converge
----------------------------------

Auto converge throttles down CPU if a progress of on-going live
migration is slow
https://docs.openstack.org/ocata/config-reference/compute/config-options.html:

.. code-block:: yaml

  nova:
    compute:
      libvirt:
        live_migration_permit_auto_converge: False  # (False is the default)

.. code-block:: yaml

  nova:
    controller:
      libvirt:
        live_migration_permit_auto_converge: False  # (False is the default)

Enhanced logging with logging.conf
----------------------------------

By default ``logging.conf`` is disabled.

That is possible to enable per-binary logging.conf with new variables:

* ``openstack_log_appender``
   Set to true to enable log_config_append for all OpenStack services

* ``openstack_fluentd_handler_enabled``
   Set to true to enable FluentHandler for all Openstack services

* ``openstack_ossyslog_handler_enabled``
   Set to true to enable OSSysLogHandler for all Openstack services

Only ``WatchedFileHandler``, ``OSSysLogHandler``, and ``FluentHandler``
are available.

Also it is possible to configure this with pillar:

.. code-block:: yaml

  nova:
    controller:
        logging:
          log_appender: true
          log_handlers:
            watchedfile:
              enabled: true
            fluentd:
              enabled: true
            ossyslog:
              enabled: true

    compute:
        logging:
          log_appender: true
          log_handlers:
            watchedfile:
              enabled: true
            fluentd:
              enabled: true
            ossyslog:
              enabled: true

The log level might be configured per logger by using the
following pillar structure:

.. code-block:: yaml

  nova:
    compute:
      logging:
        loggers:
          <logger_name>:
            level: WARNING

  nova:
    compute:
      logging:
        loggers:
          <logger_name>:
            level: WARNING

Configure syslog parameters for libvirtd
----------------------------------------

To configure syslog parameters for libvirtd the below pillar
structure should be used with values which are supported
by libvirtd. These values might be known from the documentation.

.. code-block:: yaml

 nova:
   compute:
     libvirt:
       logging:
         level: 3
         filters: '3:remote 4:event'
         outputs: '3:syslog:libvirtd'
         buffer_size: 64

Logging controls:

Logging level: 4 errors, 3 warnings, 2 information, 1 debug
basically 1 will log everything possible ``log_level = 3``

Logging filters:

A filter allows to select a different logging level for a given category
of logs.

The format for a filter is one of:

* ``x:name``
* ``x:+name``
   where name is a string which is matched against source file name,
   e.g., ``remote``, ``qemu``, or ``util/json``, the optional ``+`` prefix
   tells libvirt to log stack trace for each message matching name,
   and x is the minimal level where matching messages should be logged:

* ``1: DEBUG``
* ``2: INFO``
* ``3: WARNING``
* ``4: ERROR``

Multiple filter can be defined in a single @filters, they just
need to be separated by spaces.

For example, to only get warning or errors from the remote layer
and only errors from the event layer: ``log_filters="3:remote 4:event``

Logging outputs:

An output is one of the places to save logging information
The format for an output can be:

* ``x:stderr``
   Output goes to stderr

* ``x:syslog:name``
   Use syslog for the output and use the given name as the ident

* ``x:file:file_path``
   output to a file, with the given filepath

   In all case the x prefix is the minimal level, acting as a filter

* ``1: DEBUG``
* ``2: INFO``
* ``3: WARNING``
* ``4: ERROR``

Multiple output can be defined, they just need to be separated by spaces.
For example, to log all warnings and errors to syslog under the libvirt
dident: ``log_outputs="3:syslog:libvirtd``

Log debug buffer size: default 64
The daemon keeps an internal debug log buffer which will be dumped
in case of crash or upon receiving a ``SIGUSR2`` signal. This setting
allows to override the default buffer size in kilobytes.
If value is ``0`` or less the debug log buffer is deactivated
``log_buffer_size = 64``

To configure the logging parameters for QEMU, the below pillar
structure and logging parameters should be used:

.. code-block:: yaml

   nova:
     compute:
        qemu:
          logging:
            handler: logd
        virtlog:
          enabled: true
          level: 4
          filters: '3:remote 3:event'
          outputs: '4:syslog:virtlogd'
          max_clients: 512
          max_size: 2097100
          max_backups: 2

Inject password to VM
---------------------

By default nova blocks up any inject to VM because
``inject_partition`` param is equal to ``-2``.
If you want to inject password to VM, you will need to
define ``inject_partition`` greater or equal to ``-1`` and
define ``inject_password`` to ``True``

For example:

.. code-block:: yaml

  nova:
    compute:
      inject_partition: '-1'
      inject_password: True

Allow the injection of an admin password for instance only at
``create`` and ``rebuild`` process.

There is no agent needed within the image to do this. If *libguestfs* is
available on the host, it will be used. Otherwise *nbd* is used. The file
system of the image will be mounted and the admin password, which is provided
in the REST API call will be injected as password for the root user. If no
root user is available, the instance won't be launched and an error is thrown.
Be aware that the injection is *not* possible when the instance gets launched
from a volume.

Possible values:

* ``True``
   Allows the injection

* ``False`` (default)
   Disallows the injection. Any via the REST API provided
   admin password will be silently ignored.

Related options:

* ``inject_partition``
   Decides about the discovery and usage of the file system.
   It also can disable the injection at all.
   (boolean value)

You can read more about injecting the administrator password here:
https://docs.openstack.org/nova/queens/admin/admin-password-injection.html

Enable libvirt control channel over TLS
---------------------------------------

By default TLS is disabled.

Enable TLS transport:

.. code-block:: yaml

  compute:
    libvirt:
      tls:
        enabled: True

You able to set custom certificates in pillar:

.. code-block:: yaml

  nova:
    compute:
      libvirt:
        tls:
          key: (certificate content)
          cert: (certificate content)
          cacert: (certificate content)
          client:
            key: (certificate content)
            cert: (certificate content)

Controlling access by `tls_allowed_dn_list`.
Enable an access control list of client certificate Distinguished Names (DNs)
which can connect to the TLS port on this server. The default is that DNs are
not checked. This list may contain wildcards such as
"C=GB,ST=London,L=London,O=Libvirt Project,CN=*" See the POSIX fnmatch function
for the format of the wildcards.
Note that if this is an empty list, no client can connect.
Note also that GnuTLS returns DNs without spaces after commas between
the fields (and this is what we check against), but the openssl x509 tool
shows spaces.

.. code-block:: yaml

  nova:
    compute:
      libvirt:
        tls:
          tls_allowed_dn_list:
            host1:
              enabled: true
              value: 'C=foo,CN=cmp1'
            host2:
              enabled: true
              value: 'C=foo,CN=cmp2'

Upgrades
========

Each openstack formula provide set of phases (logical bloks) that will help to
build flexible upgrade orchestration logic for particular components. The list
of phases might and theirs descriptions are listed in table below:

+-------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| State                         | Description                                          |
+===============================+======================================================+
| <app>.upgrade.service_running | Ensure that all services for particular application  |
|                               | are enabled for autostart and running                |
+-------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| <app>.upgrade.service_stopped | Ensure that all services for particular application  |
|                               | disabled for autostart and dead                      |
+-------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| <app>.upgrade.pkgs_latest     | Ensure that packages used by particular application  |
|                               | are installed to latest available version.           |
|                               | This will not upgrade data plane packages like qemu  |
|                               | and openvswitch as usually minimal required version  |
|                               | in openstack services is really old. The data plane  |
|                               | packages should be upgraded separately by `apt-get   |
|                               | upgrade` or `apt-get dist-upgrade`                   |
|                               | Applying this state will not autostart service.      |
+-------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| <app>.upgrade.render_config   | Ensure configuration is rendered actual version.     +
+-------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| <app>.upgrade.pre             | We assume this state is applied on all nodes in the  |
|                               | cloud before running upgrade.                        |
|                               | Only non destructive actions will be applied during  |
|                               | this phase. Perform service built in service check   |
|                               | like (keystone-manage doctor and nova-status upgrade)|
+-------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| <app>.upgrade.upgrade.pre     | Mostly applicable for data plane nodes. During this  |
|                               | phase resources will be gracefully removed from      |
|                               | current node if it is allowed. Services for upgraded |
|                               | application will be set to admin disabled state to   |
|                               | make sure node will not participate in resources     |
|                               | scheduling. For example on gtw nodes this will set   |
|                               | all agents to admin disable state and will move all  |
|                               | routers to other agents.                             |
+-------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| <app>.upgrade.upgrade         | This state will basically upgrade application on     |
|                               | particular target. Stop services, render             |
|                               | configuration, install new packages, run offline     |
|                               | dbsync (for ctl), start services. Data plane should  |
|                               | not be affected, only OpenStack python services.     |
+-------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| <app>.upgrade.upgrade.post    | Add services back to scheduling.                     |
+-------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| <app>.upgrade.post            | This phase should be launched only when upgrade of   |
|                               | the cloud is completed. Cleanup temporary files,     |
|                               | perform other post upgrade tasks.                    |
+-------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| <app>.upgrade.verify          | Here we will do basic health checks (API CRUD        |
|                               | operations, verify do not have dead network          |
|                               | agents/compute services)                             |
+-------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
